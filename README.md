# About.me

Hi there!

This is Busra and this document is created to represent the most relevant information 
about myself that is more contemplating, comprehendible than a formal CV.

## Who am I?

- Software Engineer for 5+ years who have worked on SRE and Platform Engineering field
- I see myself an engineer who keeps things afloat with a strict mindset of enabling people/engineers
- My contribution to a team mostly are: inclusive, transparent, effective communication, bringing pragmatic solutions with end-to-end follow up
- I am a generalist and see my job as building puzzles, I like discussing solutions in a big picture, care about stakeholder management
- I need to see the impact of my job/tasks before diving into anything technical and that is what keeps me motivated
- I'd always take the opportunity of leading people, projects comfortably


## Things I value

- Trust, transparency and collaboration are my main values
- Authenticity does not come without psychological safety in a team
- Short feedback loops are essentials for building trust
- Continuous learning by doing is important to me, I don't know everything but I can learn almost anything

## Technical skills

- Very efficient infra-as-code programmer with tools: Terraform, Ansible, Packer, Helm
- Not a typical coder, more like a scripter for automating things and getting things done with: Python, sometimes Bash
- Have worked mostly with Cloud Providers: GCP, AWS
- A good amount of experience with Container Orchestration tools: Mesos-Marathon, Nomad, Kubernetes. Kubernetes is the one I know/use the most
- Have been a Linux and POSIX compliant OSes user all of my career. Know my way around it but would still learn a new thing about it every day
- Documentation, efficient monitoring and automation are my biggest interest in daily work
- I also like to advocate for efficient on-call, incident management and post mortems


## Things I like doing

- Public speaking: when I have a story to tell
- Mentoring others: Computer science students, junior team members
- Helping the organization I am part of: advocating for diversity, mental health and recruiting


## Where do I see myself thriving?

- A company and team culture with the values that I can identify with: transparency, feedback culture, collaboration, respect
- In the last 3 years, I kept getting the feedback that I am excellent at leading. I do enjoy it as well and in fact, I do see myself leading a team in the near future
- A place that understands the DevOps and a good engineering culture
- I am a hard-worker if I believe in the impact, and I do take my mental health seriously. A place with a balance is important.
- As of last, I believe a workplace should be about two-way conversation. It is a relationship that needs regular care. I imagine a place where both employee and employer mutually benefit each other at their best interest
